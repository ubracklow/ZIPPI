ZIPPI

LearnITGirl Project 

ZIPPI ist the working title of the programm I am writing while learning Python. I will create a web application to make travel planning easier. Create a map of the country you want to go to, pin everything that you hear or read about and that interests you sorted by category (culture, nature, accomodation, nightlife, etc.), add your comment and/or link. The final map will help you decide which route to take, which cities or sights not to miss and to have all information in one place. 

(The name ZIPPI is inspired by a german short story by author Kurt Tucholsky - Der Reisegott Zippi)
